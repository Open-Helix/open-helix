# OPEN HELIX — NBML v0.2.1

[![NBML Validation](https://github.com/Open-Helix/open-helix/actions/workflows/nbml-validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Open-Helix/open-helix/actions/workflows/nbml-validate.yml)

**NBML** — Narrative Beat Markup Language (tiny interchange format).  
**HELIX-VAL** — structural validator CLI.  
**NVE** — CVE-style registry of narrative failure modes (with patches).  
**OMU** — public-domain NBML examples.

NBML: A Tiny Open Standard for Story Structure

**What is NBML?**
NBML (Narrative Beat Markup Language) is a simple, human-readable format for representing the structure of a story — the beats, arcs, callbacks, stakes — in a way both humans and machines can read.

Think of it like JSON or YAML, but for stories: a single page of rules that makes narrative structure portable, validatable, and sharable across tools.

NBML as we’ve framed it is new — We didn’t just name an existing thing, we’ve created a format and framing that fills a gap most people feel but haven’t formalized.

**Here’s the landscape:**
- In AI + creative tech, everyone knows about JSON, XML, YAML for data.
- In storytelling, there are countless prose formats, screenwriting standards (Fountain, Final Draft), and markup like Markdown — but nothing standard for story structure that’s both machine-readable and human-readable.
- Researchers, game writers, AI developers all hack together ad-hoc ways to describe beats and arcs — but they’re bespoke, not shareable.
- The AI narrative generation community knows this is missing — if you’ve tried to measure or reproduce a model’s story structure, it’s a nightmare without a shared schema.

So: NBML is a brand new “missing piece” that most AI/creative devs will not recognize by name, but will instantly get the value of when shown in context.

**Why now?**
- We can generate text with AI, but there’s no shared way to represent structure — so every tool reinvents it, and outputs can’t be compared or improved systematically.
- Without a common format, researchers can’t run apples-to-apples benchmarks on story coherence, and creative tools can’t exchange story structures.
- NBML fills that gap.

**What’s in the repo?**
- NBML Spec (v0.2) – the minimal rules for beats, arcs, callbacks.
- HELIX-VAL Validator – checks any NBML file for structural integrity and outputs a score.
- NVE Registry – a CVE-style catalog of common narrative failure modes, with reproducible fixes.
- OMU Examples – public-domain stories converted into NBML so you can see it in action.

**Why it matters**
- Interoperability: Any tool can import/export NBML.
- Validation: Automatic checks catch structural flaws before they hit production.
- Research: Reproducible datasets for AI narrative generation.
- Collaboration: Writers, devs, and AI systems can speak the same structural language.

**See it in action**
- View a public-domain story in NBML.
- Run it through HELIX-VAL: get a structural score and a list of issues.
- Apply NVE patches: watch the score go up.

**Get involved**
- Use NBML in your project (see 'For Product Teams')
- Join the NBML 1.0 Working Group
- Submit to the 48-Hour Fix-My-Plot Clinic and see your story repaired in NBML.
